      <h1>My biography</h1>
      <p>
       <strong>
        My name is Aishatu Salisu Suleiman. I was brought up in Bauchi State, Nigeria, and I hold a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) 
        degree in Computer Science. 
 
        I'm <mark>passionate about technology</mark> and always eager to learn something new. I enjoy coding, solving problems, 
        and staying curious about how things work in the digital world. 
         
        One of the things I love most is sharing knowledge whether it's helping someone understand a tech concept or just 
        exchanging ideas with others. I believe that learning is even more by powerful when it's more powerful shared. 
         
        Outside of tech, I enjoy listening to interesting conversations and gists. I see it as a way to learn from different perspectives. 
        I'm walking towards using my skills not only to grow professionally but also to inspire others especially young women, to explore opportunities in technology.

      <h1>what motivates me to join the program</h1>
      <q>A journey of a thousand miles begin with just a step</q>
      I joined AltSchool because I'm passionate about technology and strongly believe in continuous learning and self-development.
       Although I already have a background in Computer Science,
        I realized that having a degree alone isn't enough in a fast-evolving tech world. 
        I wanted to go beyond theory and gain hands-on experience in building real-world solutions and that is exactly what AltSchool offers. 
      The program provides a practical, project-based approach to learning, which I find very valuable. 
      I also love that it connects students with a community of mentors, peers, and professionals who are all working towards similar goals.
       This kind of environment motivates me to push myself and stay consistent. 
      One of my main reasons for joining AltSchool is to add to the skills I already have, especially in software development, 
      problem-solving, and collaboration. I want to become more confident in building applications from scratch and to keep up with current
       technologies and tools. I believe AltSchool will help me achieve these goals and prepare me for a successful career in tech.

      <h1>My goal in the School of Engineering</h1>
      <blockquote>Engineering is not only about solving problems, but about creating solutions that make the world a better place.</blockquote>
      My primary goal in the School of Engineering at AltSchool is to become a well-rounded, skilled software engineer 
      who can build meaningful and scalable solutions to real-world problems. I want to gain not just technical knowledge, 
      but also the confidence and experience needed to work on practical projects whether individually or as part of a team. 
One of the key reasons I chose the engineering track is because I'm deeply interested in how software is designed, built, 
and maintained. I want to understand everything from the fundamentals of programming to more advanced concepts like system 
architecture, data structures, algorithms, and DevOps. My goal is to build a solid technical foundation that will prepare
 me for complex development tasks in the future. 
 
In addition to technical mastery, I want to improve my problem-solving abilities. I aim to approach challenges with creativity 
and logical thinking, learning to break problems down into manageable parts and finding efficient solutions. I also want to build 
strong debugging and testing skills to ensure I write clean, reliable, and maintainable code. 
 
Another important goal for me is to become more collaborative. I want to learn how to work effectively in teams using tools like 
Git and GitHub, participate in code reviews, and communicate clearly with other developers. I believe strong teamwork is essential
 in any tech environment. 
 
Long-term, I hope to use the knowledge and skills I gain at AltSchool to contribute to tech projects that make a positive impact in 
my community and beyond. I also hope to mentor and inspire other young women who want to venture into tech, just like I'm doing now. 
 
In summary, my goal is to leave AltSchool not just with certificates, but with the competence, confidence, and connections that will
 empower me to thrive in the world of software engineering.
