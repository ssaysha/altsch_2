      Hello! My name is <strong>Aishatu Salisu Suleiman</strong>. I'm a Computer
      Science graduate and an aspiring software engineer from Bauchi State,
      Nigeria. Technology has always fascinated me from how websites work to how
      mobile apps are built. That curiosity led me to pursue a B.Tech in
      Computer Science, and now I am continuing my learning journey at AltSchool
      Africa under the School of Engineering. My decision to join AltSchool came
      from a strong desire to grow beyond the classroom. I did not just want to
      understand the theory behind technology. I wanted to learn how to build
      real things that solve real problems. AltSchool's hands-on approach,
      communitydriven learning, and project based system aligned perfectly with
      what I was looking for in a tech learning experience. I have a genuine
      passion for coding and learning. I am the kind of person who loves
      figuring out how things work, breaking problems down, and experimenting
      until I find solutions. I believe that the best way to grow in tech is to
      stay curious and to never stop learning. That is why I always seek
      opportunities to expand my knowledge and challenge myself with new tools,
      languages, and concepts. One of my goals is to become not just a
      developer, but a well-rounded problem-solver someone who can work on
      projects that impact people's lives in meaningful ways. I am also
      passionate about knowledge sharing. I enjoy teaching and helping others,
      especially women and young girls who are interested in joining the tech
      space. I believe representation matters, and I want to be a role model for
      those who feel like tech is not for them. When I am not writing code or
      reading tech articles, I love listening to gists and conversations that
      offer different perspectives on life. I find joy in simple things
      connecting with people, understanding their stories, and learning from
      them. The journey ahead is long, but I am excited about every step. I know
      that with dedication, support, and the right resources, I will be able to
      achieve my dreams and contribute meaningfully to the world of technology.
